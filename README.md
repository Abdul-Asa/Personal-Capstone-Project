# Personal-Capstone-Project

My submission for the Personal Capstone Project by Stutern

## Padrone üöÄ - Tinder... but for jobs ;)

Padrone is a web application that allows users to create accounts and post/apply to jobs on the platform.

**Live Demo** üëÅ - https://asa-padrone.herokuapp.com

## Built with...

### Excalidraw

I planned out and drew out the designs in excalidraw. You can find my designs [here](https://excalidraw.com/#json=5728741804212224,fbr5-izU8ch7qMDtrpHsKg). Some of the ideas may have been scraped out (I was too ambitious at the start) but the fundamentals were implemented.

### Cloudinary

This is where I store user pfp, job images and other images used in the web site.

### EmailJS

This is an npm package used to send emails. So yes...I can see the messages you submit on the home page

### Chakra UI

‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. I really can't express how much I loved using this react component library. I started out this project using pure css. After some frustration (I can't center divs to save my life), I decided to use a UI library. My first choice was material-ui but I learnt that chakra was made by a Nigerian so I had to rep üá≥üá¨. A choice I did not regret.

### Nodemailer

Another npm package to send emails. This one is used for sending confirmation emails after a user signs up. It was kinda buggy so I just displayed the link immediately a user signed up with an alert.

### MongoDB Atlas, Heroku and Github(duh)

The basics. Atlas for my Database System. Deployed on Heroku. I also tried using Github Actions for CI/CD. Tried.

## Conclusion

It was an interesting ride making Padrone. Changing ideas every second, figuring out the designs and lots and lots (and I mean **lots**)of Google searching. It was a fun ride. Feel free to check out some of my other Projects in my Github repo. Padrone is probably my biggest project for now.
